PHASE 1 BASELINE OUTPUTS
========================

Owner: ANIKET

Purpose: Store outputs from basic LoRA baseline training

What goes here:
- models/       : Trained baseline LoRA checkpoint
- results/      : baseline_results.json (evaluation metrics)
- logs/         : Training logs and console output

Expected outputs:
- baseline_results.json containing:
  * Accuracy before/after training
  * Forgetting metric
  * Training configuration

Who uses this:
- Sarghi will read baseline_results.json to compare with other methods
- Aniket will use this as foundation for Phase 2
