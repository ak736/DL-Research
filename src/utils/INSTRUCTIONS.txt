SHARED UTILITIES
================

Owner: ALL (shared code)

Purpose: Common functions used across all phases

Files to create:
- data_loader.py      : Dataset loading functions
- metrics.py          : Evaluation metrics (accuracy, ECE, Brier)
- visualization.py    : Plotting functions
- config.py           : Configuration helpers

What goes here:
- Functions used by multiple phases
- Standard evaluation metrics
- Data preprocessing
- Common plotting code

Guidelines:
- Keep functions general and reusable
- Document all functions clearly
- Add unit tests if time permits
- Don't put phase-specific code here

Used by:
- All team members

When:
- Week 1-2: Basic utilities
- Add more as needed throughout project
